# hello-world
My first repository

Hey Git, My name is Nikhilesh Raut. I am trying to equip myself with skills and I want to do justice with myself and these 4 years I have invested in doing engineering. But yes, I am also an IAS aspirant and I want to serve my nation by being a bureaucrat.

Thanks and Regards,
Nikhilesh Raut
